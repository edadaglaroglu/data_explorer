Data Explorer: Natural Language Data Exploration with Pandas and OpenAIðŸ¤–

This project is a Streamlit application designed for exploring data files (CSV) through natural language interaction, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The app allows users to upload a CSV file, interact with the dataset, and gain insights using natural language queries. One of the key features of this project is the use of LangChain's Pandas DataFrame Agent, which acts as a middle layer to process data-related tasks dynamically, using natural language commands rather than traditional Pandas operations.

#Features

CSV File Upload: Easily upload a CSV file through the web interface.
Data Summary: Automatically generates a summary of the dataset, including sample data, missing values, duplicate data, and basic statistics.
Variable Trend Analysis: Visualize the trends of selected variables with an interactive line chart.
Natural Language Interaction: Ask questions about the dataset in natural language and receive insights powered by OpenAI GPT-4, with the help of a Pandas DataFrame Agent.
Files

This project uses two primary Python scripts:

@datahelper.py:
This script contains the core logic for summarizing the dataset, analyzing trends, and answering user queries, using a Pandas DataFrame Agent.
The agent replaces the need for traditional Pandas DataFrame operations by allowing interaction with the dataset via natural language commands.
Functions include:
summarize_csv(): Summarizes the uploaded CSV by providing a sample of the data, descriptions of columns, and checking for missing and duplicate values. It leverages the Pandas DataFrame Agent to parse and explain the data.
get_dataframe(): Loads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, although the main interaction happens through the agent.
analyze_trend(): Uses the Pandas DataFrame Agent to analyze trends in a selected variable and provide insights.
ask_question(): Allows users to ask custom questions about the dataset, and the agent interacts with GPT-4 to generate an answer in natural language.

@app.py:
This script is the front-end of the application, built using Streamlit.
The app interacts with the user, handles file uploads, and calls functions from datahelper.py to generate data insights using the Pandas DataFrame Agent.
Layout includes:
Sidebar: For uploading the CSV file.
Data Summary Section: Displays data overview such as sample data, missing values, duplicate status, and basic metrics.
Data Interaction Section: Allows users to select a variable, analyze its trend, and ask natural language questions about the data.
How It Works

CSV Upload:
Users can upload a CSV file through the Streamlit sidebar.
Upon clicking "Load", the file is processed by the Pandas DataFrame Agent, which summarizes the data.
Data Summary:
The Pandas DataFrame Agent analyzes the dataset and provides a preview of the data (first few rows).
It identifies missing and duplicate data, generates descriptive statistics, and displays them in an easily interpretable format.
Data Interaction:
Users can select a specific variable (column) from the dataset and analyze its trends using a line chart generated by the agent.
Users can ask natural language questions, and the agent, in collaboration with GPT-4o, responds with a detailed answer about the dataset.

#Pandas DataFrame Agent
Instead of performing traditional Pandas operations directly, this application utilizes a Pandas DataFrame Agent, provided by the LangChain framework. The agent interacts with the dataset using natural language prompts. This allows for flexible data exploration without writing specific Pandas code. 

The agent can:
Generate data summaries.
Detect missing or duplicate data.
Provide variable-level insights and trends.
Answer user-specific questions about the dataset in plain language.
The agent is also integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4, which helps interpret and respond to user queries in a meaningful way.

#Requirements

To run the application, you need the following:

1. Python Packages
LangChain: For integrating with OpenAI's GPT-4 model and using the Pandas DataFrame Agent.
Streamlit: For the web interface.
Pandas: For data processing and manipulation.
dotenv: For loading environment variables.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to integrate natural language processing with data exploration using OpenAI's GPT-4 and LangChain's Pandas DataFrame Agent. By utilizing the agent, users can interact with datasets in a conversational manner, making it easier to derive insights without writing complex code.

Feel free to explore the dataset and interact with it using natural language!
